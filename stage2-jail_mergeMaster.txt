#done with the jail common part ( template )
#now we can move on to create a jail service

#As a last step, create a generic /home/j/skel/etc/make.conf containing this line:
#
#WRKDIRPREFIX?=  /s/portbuild
#This makes it possible to compile FreeBSD ports inside each jail. Remember that the ports directory is part of the read-only system. The custom path for WRKDIRPREFIX allows builds to be done in the read-write portion of every jail.

# cpfong for post config
